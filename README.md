SCE provides a "Budget Assistant Alert" email about two weeks before a bill is sent to let you know what you think the estimated bill will be. SCE provides a lot of great data. Can I do a better job estimating? What if we keep running the estimation model right up until the bill is sent - what will the estimation error look like? Besides the current month trend, should we look back a year ago? How does weather impact electricity usage?
